.SH DESCRIPTION
.B id3ed
edits the "id3" tag for mpeg layer3 files.  The mpeg3 specification does not
provide any method for storing song information, however the id3 tag has
become a standard method for doing this, and most mp3 players can read the
tag.  It will not cause any errors in players that do not support it.
The tag is 128 bytes long and is located at the end of the file.
.P
The -[snayckg] options can be used to set default values for each field of
the id3 tag.  With -q, these options can be used to set some or all of the
id3 fields to a certain value without prompting for editing.  Specifing -q
twice will disable the printing of which files are modified.
.P
The -[SNAYCKG] options allow you to edit only the tags you wish.  Other tags can
still be set with their respective options.  For example, if you have a bunch of
songs off of a single cd, most of the info is the same, and you will probably
only want to set the songname manually for each track:
.P
.B id3ed 
-n 
.B SomeArtist 
-a 
.B SomeAlbum 
-y 
.B Someyear 
-S 
.B *.mp3
.P
Genres can be entered either using their name or code number.  To match by name
however, it must match exactly (case insensitive).  -l displays a listing of
known genres.  -L displays the same list, but in a row/column order rather than
column/row.  Unknown genres can be used by specifying their code.  255 is the
generally accepted code for "unknown".
.P
Tags can be removed from files with the -r option.  Only files that actually
have a tag in them will be modified.  The -q option will disable the printing
of which files had tags removed.  The -i option will list the tags in files, and,
if used with the -[SNAYCKG] options, will print only the relevant fields, with 
a second -q omitting the field name and tag version.
.P
The -M option will rename the file according to FORMAT. FORMAT is a string, with %
escapes to denote TAG values. The ".mp3" at the end of the file will be automatically
appended. The -m option does the same, except instead of renaming the file, it will
simply print the output filename the FORMAT string will generate.
.P
FORMAT controls the output. Interpreted sequences are:
.P
%%      A literal %
.P
%s      The Song's Title
.P
%n      The Artist's Title
.P
%a      The Album Title
.P
%c      The Comment
.P
%k      The Track Number
.P
%y      The Year
.P
%g      The Genre eg. Country, Disco, etc
.P
%G      The Genre number eg. 29
.P
The version and license information can be viewed with the -v option.
.SH NOTES
In interactive mode, if you do not have readline, specifying an empty string is interpeted as keeping the value the same.  If you wish to actually clear the value of the current tag, use the EOT char, ctrl-d.  (If you are using readline, the input is automatically set to the current value, so erasing it and hitting enter is interpeted as clearing the tag.)
.SH BUGS
There is no sanity checking of mp3 files, id3ed will happily add tags to any
files you tell it to.
